# Job-Market-Analysis

In this Power BI case study, I explored a job posting dataset to uncover insights for a fictional recruitment company called DataSearch. I used Power Query to investigate and clean the data to find out what skills are most in-demand for data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers. Then I used DAX to build insightful visualizations of my findings. Finally, I've brought it all together using everything Power BI has to offer to create a business dashboard so that I can answer questions for the DataSearch team.
